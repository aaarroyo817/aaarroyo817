Hi! My name is Alex Arroyo. I'm a computer science student majoring in software development and studying at the University of Illinois Chicago.

I grew up in a time where technology like computers, mobile phones, and game consoles had become common things within most households. 
Being surrounded by all these things sparked my curiosity in programming and software. My first experience with coding started with a
small demo being taught in the fifth grade using Scratch. Ever since then, I knew I wanted to pursue programming.

My passion was furthered in high school where I started using HTML/CSS for web development, Python for more creative projects including music and
drawing, and Java for regular projects. As I moved my passion to college, I would learn both C and C++, learn to use IDEs like VSCode, and use 
debugging tools like gdb and vim.

I now aim to find work experience through internships so improve my skills in app and game development, so that I can create the same things that 
got me interested in computer science in the first place.
